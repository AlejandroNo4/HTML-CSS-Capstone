**This project is from the Microverses' HTML & CSS curriculum.**
The goal was to build a page based on a website conference, following these instructions:

- Follow the clients' colors, layouts, and design guidelines.
- To have 3 pages as a minimum.
- Responsiveness with one breakpoint

Besides the style, it was made to apply all the knowledge and techniques acquired during the past projects, which are mentioned below.
